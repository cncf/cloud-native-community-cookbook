Going to a plant-based lifestyle wasn’t a big jump for us, but one thing I really missed was a good ole' fashioned soup and sandwhich lunch combo. After some experimenting (and quite a few misses), we found a perfect soup for cool fall evenings that tastes great as leftovers with a delicious, hearty sandwhich the next day. 

# Creamy Wild Rice Soup (sans the cream)


This soup is a winter favorite at our house. It’s a solid wild rice soup with loads of veggies, perfect for cold days. Best off all, no oil or dairy!

## Ingredients

- 1 package (8 oz.) of baby bella mushrooms, sliced
- 4 cloves of garlic,  minced
- 1 onion (yellow or white), diced
- 3 stalks of celery, diced
- 3 large carrots, peeled and diced
- 2 yukon gold potoates, peeled and diced
- 1/4 tsp sage leaves
- 1/4 tsp thyme leaves
- 1 cup of uncooked wild rice
- 4 cups + 2tbsps  of vegetable broth
- 1 can (13 oz.) of full-fat coconut milk

## Get cooking!

1. Wash your mushrooms and slice them (if they aren't pre-sliced). While you're slicing, pre-heat your dutch oven or soup pot. Add a tablespoon of vegetrable broth and your sliced mushrooms. Saute the mushrooms until the moisture is released, evaporates, and the mushrooms brown.
2. Once the mushrooms are browned, add the garlic, onion, celery, carrots, thyme, and sage with an additional tablespoon of broth to the mushrooms. Saute for five minutes, until the onions are translucent.
3. Add your wild rice, diced potatoes, and vegetable broth, stirring to combine. Heat on medium-high until you have a rolling boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer, cover the pot, and let the soup cook on a low simmer for 45 minutes, unless the rice instructions call for more time.
4. Once the rice is cooked, add the can of coconut milk, stir, and simmer for another 5 minutes. 
5. We like to serve ours with a crunchy sourdough bread.
